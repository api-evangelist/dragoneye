      Dragoneye is a computer vision platform designed to democratize access to
      advanced image and video recognition technologies. It enables developers
      to build and deploy custom models tailored to their specific use cases
      without the need for coding or data labeling. By automating the entire
      processfrom model specification to deploymentDragoneye eliminates the
      traditional complexities associated with computer vision development.
